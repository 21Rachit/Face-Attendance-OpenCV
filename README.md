# Face Attendance System using OpenCV

An efficient module that comprises of face recognition using OpenCV to manage the attendance records.
Face recognition has taken a dramatic change in today’s world of, it has been widely spread throughout last few years in drastic way. Their have been some drastic improvements in last few years which has made it so much popular that now it is being widely used for commercial purpose as well as security purpose also.Tracking a users presence is becoming one of the problems in today’s world, so an attendance system based on facial recognition can act as a real world solution to this problem and add great heights of simplicity for tracking a users attendance.

The manual entering of attendance in logbooks becomes difficult and takes a lot of time also, so we have designed an efficient module that comprises of face recognition using LBPH algorithm(OpenCV) to manage the attendance records of employee or students. During enrolling of a user, we take multiple images of a user along with his/her id/roll number and name also.The presence of each student/employee will be updated in database, and the user can check their attendance on the webpage also. The results showed improved performance over manual attendance system.This process can give us more accurate results in user interactive manner rather than the existing attendance systems.This also gives students/employees a more accurate result in user interactive manner rather than existing attendance management system.

## Following are some important points to remember - 

1. This is an attendance system prototype using OpenCV.The best thing about this project is that you do not need to provide multiple
2. Images of yourself for training, but you just need to look at the camera for 10 seconds(with different face angles for better training) and you photos will automatically be saved .
3. I have used pretrained OpenCV model named Local Binary Patterns Histograms for training the model.
4. After your face had been successfully trained whenever you will look at the camera your name will be displayed on the screen.
