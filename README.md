This is an attendance system prototype using OpenCV.The best thing about this project is that you do not need to provide multiple
images of yourself for training, but you just need to look at the camera for 10 seconds(with different face angles for better training)
and you photos will automatically be saved .I have used pretrained OpenCV model named Local Binary Patterns Histograms for training the model.
After your face had been successfully trained whenever you will look at the camera your name will be displayed on the screen.
